Hey guyz, i am babe's only living sibling since we were infants.<br/> We both grew up very poor and we were always looking for food on the streets. <br/> The great depression was when my family really struggled. <br/> Luckily, my big bro got some great paychecks from the game itself (baseball) XD!

I am Babe's best bud in baseball. We played together for years on the Yankees, and even a few on the Red Sox.<br/>
I am famous for having the most wins in Baseball World Series record.<br/>
I also became an announcer for many teams, and I am known for my story telling when games get rained out.
